# B2B_Invoice_Management
I have built an AI-Enabled FinTech B2B Invoice Management Application using bucket level prediction for invoices. It uses a regression model to predict whether payment of order will be delayed or not. The same has been deployed using Flask Framework for machine learning integration, React JS for frontend, MySQL for database management and Java servlets for backend.
